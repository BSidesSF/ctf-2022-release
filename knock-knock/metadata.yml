  We've bought this door lock controller.  The PIN is stored in a flash chip,
  but we're concerned the vendor may have built-in a backdoor too!  Can you
  find the key sequence for the backdoor?

  We've convinced the vendor to share a schematic and the firmware ELF, but
  they claim the source is "proprietary intellectual property".

  Note that this challenge does *not* conform to the standard flag format.
  The correct entry is 12 characters long (i.e., the shortest functional unlock
  code).
