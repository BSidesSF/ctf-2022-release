  RIFF  2646036
-----------------

File is a RIFF with two chunks. A webp chunk with a telephone showing
a DTMF grid and a second RIFF chunk with a WAV file with a DTMF
recording of "4354467B6469616C5#665#666#725#666C61677D"

Image is directly visible using most image viewers without any
trouble. They simply ignore the second chunk.

Wave can be extracted with:
dd if=hello.webp bs=15362 skip=1 of=/tmp/out.wav

When DTML is translated to hex (# -> F) using the grid in the image
results in 4354467B6469616C5F665F666F725F666C61677D

$ perl -e 'print pack("H*", "4354467B6469616C5F665F666F725F666C61677D"), "\n";'
CTF{dial_f_for_flag}
