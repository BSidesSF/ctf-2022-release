Lock is the master dial lock 'm1573l.jpg'. This is the only combo lock
in the photos.

The recording is clicks of each letter as the lock is turned followed
by a sound when it is stopped on the right letter of the flag and then
turned around.

Visual inspection of the waveform of the recording is enough to
identify the distances of all the letters from each other. The initial
starting position (which letter the dial started on) must be
brute-forced and the starting turning direction must be brute forced,
making for 40 possible flags. Only one will read out English words.
