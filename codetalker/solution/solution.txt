1) File is bz2, extract

2) File is text grid with list of moves from (U)u, (D)own, (R)ight,
(L)left and base64 text has been encoded in a snaking grid following
the moves.

3) Find ending b64 == and work backwards to the start. You need to
start at the end because the beginning is ambigous.

4) Decode un-snaked b64 to get xz file, extract to get random-ish
looking text blob.

5) Blob has a string at top that looks like the alphabet in an odd
order. It's the b64 character set where the lower bit has been flipped
(xor 1).  Flip bit back and un-b64.

6) File is gzip. Extract to get obvious hexdump text scrambled
slightly. Each line is 2 lines, the first the even characters, the
second the odd characters. Text "example" -> "eape", "xml" is written
at top to make this more obvious. Also anyone familiar with canonical
hexdump will spot the basic scrambling.

7) Decode hexdump. File is lzma. Extract lzma

8) Result is text of Phi and phi (φΦ). Phi -> 1; phi -> 0 to get binary.

9) Decode binary to get flag:
