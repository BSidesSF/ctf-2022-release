  Heya,

  Welcome to Shellcode Hurdles ("shellc-urdles"?)!

  This platform will let you write and test *shellcode*, then complete some
  random challenges!

  First off, let's learn how to write code. :)

  You have two choices on how to send code for each level:

  Either you can just write (or probably paste) your x64 code below, followed by a period alone on a line; something like:

  ```asm
    xor rax, rax
    ret
    .
  ```

  Or, you can paste a string of hex here, followed by a newline; eg:

  ```
    31c0c3
  ```

  For this level, can you just run the code above?

completion: "Well done, now for a real challenge!"
flag: null
password: ""

checker: |
  if result['exit_code'] != 0
    raise "Your code did not return 0: #{ result['exit_code'] || result['exit_reason'] }"
  end

solution: |
  xor rax, rax
  ret
