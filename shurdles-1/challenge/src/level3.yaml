  Can you exit with code 3, but without using a `ret` or `syscall` this time?

  Hint: The address the `ret` wants to go to is whatever is on the top of the stack.
  You can get that using `pop &lt;reg&gt;` then `jmp &lt;reg&gt;` instead of `ret`!

  if result['history'][-1]['rip']['as_instruction'] =~ /ret/i
    raise "Uh oh! Looks like you used `ret` at the end!"
  end

  if result['history'][-1]['rip']['as_instruction'] =~ /syscall/i
    raise "Uh oh! Looks like you used `ret` at the end!"
  end

  if result['exit_code'] != 3
    raise "Your code did not return 3: #{ result['exit_code'] }"
  end

  mov rax, 3
  pop rbx
  jmp rbx
