  Let's start easy: can you crash at the address 0x12345678?

  Hint: The easiest way is to `mov` the address into a register then `jmp` to it

completion: "You crashed, but it's a good thing!"
flag: null
password: ""

checker: |
  if result['history'][-1]['rip']['value'] != 0x12345678
    raise "Sorry, you did not crash at 0x12345678!"
  end

solution: |
  mov rax, 0x12345678
  jmp rax
