  Instead of jumping, can you `ret` to 0x12345678? That is, your last instruction
  should be `ret`, and the shellcode should crash at 0x12345678!

  Hint: We learned in the last challenge that `ret` jumps to whatever is on top
  of the stack!

  if result['history'][-1]['rip']['value'] != 0x12345678
    raise "Sorry, you did not crash at 0x12345678!"
  end

  if result['history'][-2] && result['history'][-2]['rip']['as_instruction'] != 'ret'
    raise "Your last instruction should be `ret`!"
  end

solution: |
  push 0x12345678
  ret
